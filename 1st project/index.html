<h3>How i found coding</h3>
<br>
<p>The way that i found coding is sort of two pronged. I went to a highschool that offered to teach basic level code like html and basic css. My younger brother kalob took off and exceled very quickly in that and now he has made an entire career out of doing what we loved to do back then. Between having a great time doing it and seeing the success that he has had in the field i became inspired. Through inspiration and a love of creativity i have found myself diving head first into this feild and all i want to do is excell and learn as much as I possibly can, I want to be the best developer that i can be reguardless of the task at hand. My goal is to be an expert in every possible catagory that i can be a part of. I look froward to working with others to create things that will cause people to move forward both creatively and in what is percieved as possible within developement and accesability for users </p>

<h3>goals for developing</h3>
<br>
<p>I have big long term goals and even more attainable short term goals, I have started where everyone starts.I chose to become serious about coding because it is something that i love to do and i want to be someone that those i love and I are proud of. My goals with this are as fallows
 <li> - To become an expert in the basics of web design and developement</li>
  <li>- To become as well versed and as much of an expert as i can be at both functionality and asthetic</li> 
    <li>- To create with and work among the best coleauges in this field</li>
      <li>- To be a part of something that moves the world forward and also helps others</li>
        <li>- To become an expert in application developement</li>
          <li>- To become and expert in animation and graphic design</li>
            <li>- To become an expert in video game developement as well</li>
              <li>- To create something that revolutionises an industry</li>
In conclusion my goals are very ambitious however I will achieve them and I work faster and better everyday!!
